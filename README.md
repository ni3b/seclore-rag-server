<strong>[Seclore](https://www.seclore.com/)</strong> is the AI Assistant connected to your company's docs, apps, and people.
Seclore provides a Chat interface and plugs into any LLM of your choice. Seclore can be deployed anywhere and for any
scale - on a laptop, on-premise, or to cloud. Since you own the deployment, your user data and chats are fully in your
own control. Seclore is dual Licensed with most of it under MIT license and designed to be modular and easily extensible. The system also comes fully ready
for production usage with user authentication, role management (admin/basic users), chat persistence, and a UI for
configuring AI Assistants.

Seclore also serves as a Enterprise Search across all common workplace tools such as Slack, Google Drive, Confluence, etc.
By combining LLMs and team specific knowledge, Seclore becomes a subject matter expert for the team. Imagine ChatGPT if
it had access to your team's unique knowledge! It enables questions such as "A customer wants feature X, is this already
supported?" or "Where's the pull request for feature Y?"
